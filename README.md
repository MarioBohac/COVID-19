# COVID-19
I wanted to make a Dashboard for the COVID-19 epidemic because I was mainly interesed in the spread of the disease and its lethality in different countries.

# Tools
__Python__ was used to clean the data and to query smaller datasets.  
The datasets were then imported into __Tableau__ to make the Dashboard.

# Data
The data came from [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data). The dataset needed only a little bit of cleaning, exploration and preparation. 

# Dashboard
You can find the Tableau Dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mario.boha./vizzes).
